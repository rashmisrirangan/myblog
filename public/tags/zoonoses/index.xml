      <description>&lt;p&gt;As warmer temperatures float through the northern hemisphere, people begin to spend more time outdoors, being one with nature and wildlife. Proximity to wildlife however, can give rise to many diseases, potentially causing outbreaks and public health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoonotic diseases refer to bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic infections that spread between animals and human beings. Human beings can contract zoonotic diseases when they make contact with animals, either via work, recreation, consumption or the environment. Humans may easily suffer insect bites, consume infected meat, or touch contaminated surfaces and fluids as part of their everyday lives. Zoonotic diseases such as Lyme Disease, West Nile Virus, Rabies, Salmonellosis or Ringworm may sound familiar to some individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
